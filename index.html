	<br>
As far as I remember, we had just started chatting last year and today we are an integral part of each others lives. I would like to use this letter as a medium to express how important you are to me because clearly other mediums are not working. First of all, a very Happy Birthday to you Sharan. The reason I am writing this letter is because Today I do not have any special gift for my husband. It's been 9 months since we got married, but I do not have anything of value to gift you except for my wishes and my heartfelt feelings. 
	<br>
	<br>
I am guessing most of the times your mood is sour is because of me. Although, I try but fail to keep you happy. Maybe something is really wrong with me that I cannot give you even the basic of happiness. So that's why my first gift for you on your Birthday is to keep you happy one day at a time. You are angry, yell at me! You are sad, blame me! You are frustrated, take it on me! Use me as your medium to flush out all those negative feelings, so that you start feeling light-hearted. Lessen your burden and stay calm. 
	<br>
	<br>
I like the way you are dedicated, futuristic, sporty &amp; competitive. Your attention to detail and your problem-solving skills are really good. I always wanted to be like that so I always admire those qualities, even feel a little bit jealous because I don't have them. You think about small things and I tend to ignore them. You are bright, smart adventurous and really talented. You like to take on new challenges whereas I fear them. I wish I could be more like you. So my second gift, I hope my compliments help make at least one of your day, especially today. 
	<br>
	<br>
Things have happened in the past, which made you feel I am untrustworthy and don't have a sense of character. You think you can share your deepest darkest secrets with other more important people in your life, but never me. You would always take their word or judgment against mine. The disparity you have with me has risen so much, that you don't care about the hurt I go through every single day. And I can't even share with you because you think I like to act as a 'victim'. Basically I am unable to share my smallest annoyances or my deepest fears because it hurts when someone thinks of what you are going through as 'bullshit'. And that's when I realized, that maybe I am hurting you in that same way, without even realizing it. Maybe, I am being equally uncaring towards your feelings, and small everyday things that matter to you. So, please accept my deepest, most sincere apology. Though words won't heal what you have gone through because of me. But I will keep on apologizing. So here is my third gift, I will always cherish and start making you my top priority. I am still trying to get around the corners here, but I will try my best. I don't know how you are going to judge it, but i will try.
	<br>
	<br>
I wish I could mean more to you than just a bed-warming partner, but that's wishful thinking eh?? Anyways, I would want to do one more thing for you. I want you to write and send me the 10 things you very much wish or want in your life and I promise in return of today's empty gifts, I will fulfill those 10 things for you to the best of my abilities. Please don't hesitate to write those 10 things down. These can be anything you desire, material things, or feelings or some work you don't want to be burdened with. I want to do this for you. So my humble request please send my this list. Or else I would be very disappointed. I hope you do this one small favor, even if it feels like a joke to you.
	<br>
	<br>
Lastly, after boring you for so long I would say I love you sweetheart with all my heart. Please never leave me alone. I long to meet you everyday, to get crushed in your arms and to be loved by you. My head craves for the warmth of your chest and shoulders. Those cuddling moments I have with you at night, is what I look forward to every single day. Your imperfections are what makes me want to love you more, because what you lack I hope to fulfil it for you and what I lack, I wish you would fulfil mine.
	<br>
	<br>
I pray to god, that you stay happy at every place, phase and walk of your life. I hope that you grow strong, stay level-headed, be ready and successfully tackle every problem of your life. I want you to dream and prosper and never accept defeat. But more of all, I wish you are at peace with yourself and everyone around you. World is never a bad place! Do good and good finds a way back, I always believed in this, though u wont agree but I do!
	<br>
	<br>
Once again, a very happy birthday sweetheart! Lots of kisses! Bye
	<br>
	<br>
	Will love you always,<br>
